# Cardiocare

This tool is used to predict heart disease. The user will be required to enter multiple values, such as age, sex, chest pain type, BP, cholesterol, etc., to give accurate results. This project was developed as part of the IBM Nalaiya Thiran initiative, launched by the Tamil Nadu State Government. In order to see the workings of the tool, please watch this video: https://vimeo.com/771656648.
